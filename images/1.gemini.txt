Topdown image with a focused camera for a for a battle grid RPG scenario, depicting a coastal settlement at night, illuminated by numerous small fires. The scene is rendered in warm, earthy tones, with the overall color palette consisting of browns, oranges, and dark blues. A grid overlay is visible, suggesting its use as a battle map. The central feature is a large, circular structure built around a massive skull, possibly a temple or shrine, with several smaller, thatched-roof huts clustered around it. These huts are constructed from various shades of brown and tan.  A wooden bridge connects the upper and lower sections of the settlement, which is situated on a cliff face overlooking the ocean. The cliff face is a dark grayish-brown, textured to suggest rock formations.  The lower section of the settlement extends onto a sandy beach, where several small overturned boats are visible along the shoreline. The ocean is dark, with hints of lighter blue-gray waves visible near the shore. The water is rendered with a slightly textured appearance.  Scattered across the settlement and beach are numerous small, glowing orange fires, providing the primary light source. Two figures are positioned near the bottom of the image on the beach, near a banner with a skull and crossbones design.  In the bottom left, there is a circular structure that resembles a well or some type of apparatus.  In the bottom right, thereâ€™s a large, light-colored creature, possibly a dragon or similar mythical being, partially obscured by shadows and rock formations.  The overall composition is symmetrical, with the central structure acting as the focal point. The camera angle is directly overhead, providing a complete view of the settlement and its surroundings.  The grid is light gray and evenly spaced, facilitating strategic placement of game elements. The artist's Patreon information is visible in the bottom right corner.
