### **Image Description for Top-Down Battlemap Generation**  

#### **1. Camera Position & Perspective**  
- **View:** True top-down (orthographic projection, no perspective distortion).  
- **Elevation:** High enough to capture the entire scene without significant foreshortening.  
- **Grid Overlay (if present):** Uniform square grid (e.g., 1x1 unit cells) for tactical movement reference.  

#### **2. Layout & Composition**  
- **Primary Area:** A rectangular or irregularly shaped playable space (e.g., dungeon room, outdoor battlefield).  
- **Boundaries:** Defined by walls, cliffs, or natural barriers (e.g., stone walls, dense foliage).  
- **Symmetry:** (Optional) May be symmetrical (e.g., a temple hall) or asymmetrical (e.g., a cave system).  

#### **3. Terrain & Environmental Features**  
- **Floor Texture:**  
  - **Material:** Stone, wood, dirt, grass, or water.  
  - **Pattern:** Cracked stone tiles, wooden planks, muddy patches, or cobblestone.  
- **Elevation Changes:**  
  - **Platforms:** Raised sections (e.g., altars, ledges) with visible edges.  
  - **Pits/Trenches:** Depressions (possibly with spikes or water).  
- **Obstacles:**  
  - **Static:** Crates, barrels, pillars, fallen trees.  
  - **Dynamic:** Movable objects (e.g., boulders, tables).  
- **Hazards:**  
  - **Traps:** Pressure plates, hidden spikes, fire jets.  
  - **Environmental:** Lava pools, deep water, slippery ice.  

#### **4. Objects & Notable Elements**  
- **Furniture/Structures:**  
  - **Central Feature:** A large table, throne, ritual circle, or altar.  
  - **Perimeter Objects:** Bookshelves, braziers, statues, or chests.  
- **Lighting:**  
  - **Sources:** Torches (wall-mounted or free-standing), glowing runes, chandeliers.  
  - **Shadows:** Minimal (top-down view reduces shadow complexity).  
- **Decorative Details:**  
  - **Bloodstains:** Indicating combat areas.  
  - **Scatter Terrain:** Bones, broken weapons, rubble.  

#### **5. Color Palette & Visual Cues**  
- **Dominant Colors:**  
  - **Stone Dungeon:** Gray, brown, muted tones.  
  - **Forest Clearing:** Greens, browns, earthy hues.  
  - **Lava Cavern:** Orange, black, red highlights.  
- **Contrast Elements:**  
  - **Important Objects:** Brighter colors (e.g., gold chests, glowing runes).  
  - **Hazards:** Red (fire/lava), blue (water/ice).  

#### **6. Grid & Scale Reference (If Applicable)**  
- **Grid Visibility:** Light gray or faded lines to avoid distraction.  
- **Scale:** 5ft squares (standard RPG battlemap scale).

### **Example Scene Breakdown**  
*For a dungeon room:*  
- **Walls:** Dark gray stone with visible mortar lines.  
- **Floor:** Checkered flagstone with occasional cracks.  
- **Objects:**  
  - **NW Corner:** A wooden barrel (brown, slightly tilted).  
  - **Center:** A bloodstained altar (reddish-brown marbling).  
  - **SE Corner:** A trapped chest (iron-bound, faint pressure plate in front).  
- **Lighting:** Torches on walls (small yellow circles with faint glow).
