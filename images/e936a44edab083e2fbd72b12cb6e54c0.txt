This top-down image depicts a detailed map of a fortified city, ideal for a battle grid in a tabletop RPG scenario. Here are the key features and elements:

1. **City Walls**: The entire city is encompassed by a sturdy stone wall with gatehouses located at regular intervals, essential for strategic planning and defense scenarios.
