4. **Central Plaza and Landmarks**: Thereâ€™s a large open plaza near the city center, likely used for gatherings or major market events. Prominent structures, possibly temples or castles, make for key narrative locations.

5. **Parks and Gardens**: Green spaces with trees and gardens offer cover and may contain hidden paths or treasures.

6. **Lakes and Water Features**: In the southern part of the city, a large lake with a feeder stream adds to the terrain complexity, creating natural barriers and opportunities for ambushes.

7. **Terrain Variation**: The surrounding rocky terrain and forests provide a mix of higher ground and concealment, important for tactics and skirmishes outside the city.

8. **Outposts or Towers**: There are smaller fortified structures and towers, useful as lookout points or objectives for control.
