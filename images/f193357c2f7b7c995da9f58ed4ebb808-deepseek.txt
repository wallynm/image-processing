**Topdown image with a focused camera for a battle grid RPG scenario, featuring a structured layout designed for tactical gameplay. The scene is set on a rectangular grid, with each square clearly delineated by thin, light-gray lines against a neutral beige background, creating a uniform playing field. The grid is divided into a 10x10 square arrangement, providing ample space for movement and positioning.  

Dominating the center of the grid is a large circular stone platform, slightly elevated with a textured surface resembling aged cobblestone, colored in muted grays and browns. Surrounding the platform are four evenly spaced braziers, each emitting a warm orange glow, suggesting flickering flames. The braziers are positioned at the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) relative to the platform, adding symmetry to the scene.  

To the northwest and southeast corners, two clusters of wooden crates and barrels are arranged, painted in earthy browns with subtle weathering details. These objects serve as potential cover or obstacles in gameplay. A single wooden table sits near the northeastern edge, adorned with scattered parchment maps and an unlit lantern, implying a strategic planning area.  

The terrain outside the central platform transitions into a dirt-packed floor with minor cracks and pebbles, enhancing the rustic aesthetic. Along the southern border, a partially collapsed stone wall segments the area, its jagged edges suggesting recent damage. A narrow pathway weaves between the wall and the central platform, allowing for flanking maneuvers.  

The camera angle is perfectly perpendicular, providing a clear, undistorted topdown perspective ideal for grid-based movement. Lighting is soft and even, with slight shadows cast by the braziers and elevated structures, adding depth without obscuring grid lines. The color palette consists of warm neutrals—browns, grays, and tans—creating a cohesive medieval-fantasy atmosphere. This setup is optimized for battlemap scenarios, balancing visual detail with functional clarity for gameplay.**
