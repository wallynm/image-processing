Topdown image with a focused camera for a battle grid RPG scenario, depicting a rugged coastal or island-themed setting. At the top center, a large skull structure is prominently displayed, with greenery and wooden elements surrounding it. The skull serves as a central focal point, with a pathway leading downwards. This path is flanked by wooden structures and huts, which are situated on raised platforms, suggesting a tribal or rustic village atmosphere. Torches are scattered across the scene, casting a warm glow and indicating possible pathways or points of interest.

On the left side, there is a circular wooden platform resembling a ritual site or meeting area. In contrast, the right side features a larger, irregularly shaped area covered with yellow-orange hues, possibly indicating a sandy or rocky terrain. Various wooden crates and barrels are positioned around this area, adding to the lived-in feel.

The bottom section of the image is dominated by dark, wave-like patterns suggesting water or a shoreline, with small wooden boats nearby, hinting at maritime activities. The entire scene is overlaid with a subtle grid pattern, aiding in its use as a battle map for tabletop RPGs. The overall color palette is earthy, with browns, greens, and oranges, enhancing the natural and adventurous setting.
