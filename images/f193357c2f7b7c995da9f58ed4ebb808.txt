Topdown image with a focused camera for a battle grid RPG scenario, the scene presents a coastal village or encampment with a tribal aesthetic. The central portion of the image displays a large wooden platform adorned with a massive skull structure at the top, giving an impression of a ceremonial or tribal altar. The skull is flanked by green foliage and surrounded by torches, casting an orange glow that illuminates the area. Various wooden huts with thatched roofs are scattered around the top and sides, contributing to the rustic theme.

The terrain appears rugged with rock formations and vegetation interspersed throughout. Pathways between the structures are evident, leading to different sections of the map. At the bottom left, there is a circular structure resembling a compass or navigational tool, and at the bottom center, a pirate-like flag is depicted, suggesting a nautical or adventurous theme.

The water body at the bottom right contrasts with the sandy or rocky ground, adding a dynamic element to the setting. The grid overlay suggests a strategic layout for gameplay, facilitating movement and positioning within the scenario. The overall color palette is earthy, dominated by browns, greens, and the warm hues of the torchlights, enhancing the immersive feel of an adventurous, tribal coastal environment.
