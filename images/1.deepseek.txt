**Topdown image with a focused camera for a battle grid RPG scenario, featuring a structured medieval town square with cobblestone pathways forming a grid-like layout. The central area is dominated by a circular stone fountain with a tiered design, emitting a faint blue glow from enchanted water. Surrounding the fountain are four wooden market stalls arranged symmetrically, each with a red-and-white striped canopy and barrels of goods placed beside them. The stalls are positioned at the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) relative to the fountain.  

The square is bordered by two-story timber-framed buildings with steep slate roofs, their facades painted in muted earth tones of brown, beige, and faded red. Narrow alleyways branch off between the buildings, leading to unseen side streets. A raised wooden platform, possibly a gallows or speaker’s stage, stands at the northern edge, flanked by two iron braziers emitting flickering orange light.  

The terrain is mostly flat, with slight elevation changes near the buildings to suggest drainage gutters. Scattered details include crates, sacks, and a overturned cart near the southeastern stall, hinting at recent activity. The cobblestones are arranged in concentric circles around the fountain, transitioning to a grid pattern toward the edges. Shadows are crisp and uniformly cast downward, reinforcing the topdown perspective. The color palette consists of warm browns, grays, and muted reds, with the fountain’s blue glow providing contrast. The camera angle is perfectly orthogonal, emphasizing the grid structure for tactical movement.**
